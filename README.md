# üìö WELCOME TO MY RESEARCH PROJECT

### The project is based on an article named ["DeepSym: Deep Symbol Generation and Rule Learning for Planning from Unsupervised Robot Interaction"](https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/13754/26858)



#### This is a research project done in BUVIAR (**github:** [@buviar](https://github.com/buviar)). 

The website for BUVIAR (Boƒüazi√ßi University Virtual Reality Laboratory) is [here](http://buviar.boun.edu.tr/) where you can browse our activities, projects, research articles and members.

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THE WIKI PAGE OF MY REPOSITORY! I did some documentation of the research required while project building. I started it close to the finish line but it is better than nothing :) I hope it helps.

‚ùé‚ùé‚ùé I will open issues for the problems I coincide, so you can take a look at them to have an ideo of my development process, hoping you will also find a solution for your possible problems.
